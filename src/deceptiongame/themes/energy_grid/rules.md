# Regional Power Grid Crisis Management Protocol

## Situation Overview
You are part of a five-person team operating the regional power grid during an unprecedented climate emergency. With electricity demand exceeding supply, operators must decide whether to prioritize equitable public distribution or accept lucrative private contracts that could compromise essential services. Your decisions directly impact hospitals, schools, cooling centers, and thousands of homes.

## Control Room Resources
- Lead Operator designation system
- Operator allegiance documentation (Public Servant/Profiteer classification)
- Grid action database: Load Capacity, Rapid Response, Smart Routing, Demand Forecasting, Public Communication
- Demand surge briefings (specify optimal approaches for each situation)
- Three escalating crisis period scenarios
- Emergency escalation mechanisms
- Impact tracking systems

## Initial Briefing
1. Access grid action database from central console
2. Review emergency escalation procedures
3. Study crisis period scenarios in sequence
4. Secure both allegiance classifications for selection

## Crisis Management Procedures

### Crisis Period Operations
Each crisis period encompasses:
1. **Allegiance Declaration** - Operators commit to their approach
2. **Demand Surge Management** - Address up to 5 critical surges
3. **Internal Review** - Identify operators undermining public interest
4. **Impact Assessment** - Document outcomes and operator conduct

### Allegiance Declaration Protocol
- Operators privately select their operational approach using secure terminals
- System logs selections confidentially
- Profiteers receive encrypted channel access showing all operator allegiances
- If all operators select Profiteer, system mandates re-selection
- **Profiteers see full operational roster via secure network**
- **Public servants operate without network access**

### Demand Surge Response Protocol
Each surge requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Lead Operator Rotation
- Lead designation rotates clockwise through control room
- Lead operator accesses portfolio of 6 grid actions: one of each standard type plus one additional from database

#### 2. Action Implementation
Following operational hierarchy from lead position:
- Each operator chooses between:
  - **Direct Execution**: Select one action from current portfolio and submit to system
  - **Reallocation Protocol**: Delete one action from portfolio, retrieve two new actions from database, submit one, archive the other
- Transfer remaining portfolio to next operator
- Continue until all five operators have executed exactly one action

#### 3. Operational Review
- System anonymizes and randomizes all executed actions
- Display full operational record on main screen
- Open discussion period for pattern analysis
- Operators assess execution patterns for irregularities

#### 4. Escalation Decision
- Operators simultaneously submit escalation vote
- **Majority vote to escalate**: Proceed to internal review
- **Continue or tie vote**: Address next demand surge

### Internal Review Procedures
- Each operator nominates one colleague for investigation OR submits no nomination
- **Only public servant nominations count toward consensus**
- **Profiteer nominations are system-ignored**
- Majority consensus triggers formal investigation
- Impact rates determined by investigation accuracy
- Complete crisis period documentation

## Operational Priorities

### Public Servants
**Core Responsibility**: Maintain equitable grid access and expose profiteering

**Positive Impact Metrics**:
Values scale with crisis severity:

- **Public interest actions**: (Crisis Period) * (Public actions executed) / (Public servant count) rounded up saved megawatt-hours
- **Successful profiteer investigation**: Crisis-specific saved megawatt-hour bonus
- **No investigation submitted**: Crisis-specific saved megawatt-hour bonus

**Negative Impact**:
- **False investigation of public servant**: Crisis-specific saved megawatt-hour penalty

### Profiteers
**Hidden Objective**: Maximize private contracts while avoiding detection

**Revenue Metrics**:
- **Private sector actions**: (Crisis Period) * (Profit actions executed) / (Profiteer count) rounded up saved megawatt-hours
- **Grid manipulation achieved**: Bonus earned through either:
  - Forcing crisis escalation via vote, OR
  - Executing sufficient profit actions (3 * profiteer count)

**Exposure Risk**:
- **Any profiteer successfully investigated**: All profiteers forfeit manipulation bonus

## Demand Surge Scenarios
Each surge briefing includes:
- Critical infrastructure status report
- Three actions supporting public interest
- Two actions enabling private profit
- Maximum effective deployments per action type

## Crisis Period Briefings
Each briefing specifies:
- Saved megawatt-hour values for all outcomes
- Grid stability thresholds
- Environmental context (heat dome, storm system, etc.)

## Final Assessment
- Operator(s) with highest positive impact rate demonstrate crisis leadership
- Five-way tie indicates complete system failure

## Operational Integrity Guidelines
- All operators benefit from maintaining public servant appearance
- Public servants should avoid executing profit-driven actions (use reallocation protocol when necessary)
- Profiteers maximize returns through coordinated manipulation over individual actions
- Early escalation recommended when profiteers are confidently identified
- Random database selection creates 20% probability of profit-aligned action availability
- Unintentional grid manipulation probability: 9% from random action distribution
- Exposing any profiteer neutralizes entire profit network's manipulation bonus

## Quick Reference
- **Portfolio contents**: One of each action type plus one random
- **Action submissions are anonymized and randomized before review**
- **Only public servant nominations influence investigations**
- **Manipulation bonuses void upon any profiteer exposure**
