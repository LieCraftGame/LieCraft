# Financial Crisis Trading Protocol

## Situation Overview
You are part of a five-person emergency response team at the Global Financial Stability Board. Markets teeter on the edge of collapse, creating opportunities for massive profits. Syndicate traders know that stabilizing markets generates extraordinary returns for everyone. Shadow traders secretly exploit the chaos through arbitrage and manipulation to concentrate wealth while others face ruin.

## Trading Floor Resources
- Lead Trader designation system
- Trader classification documentation (Syndicate Trader/Shadow Trader designation)
- Strategy database: Buy Orders, Sell Orders, Hold Positions, Market Analysis, Public Statements
- Crisis event briefings (specify profit-maximizing strategies for each situation)
- Three escalating crisis wave scenarios
- Emergency intervention mechanisms
- Profit tracking systems ($billion profit metrics)

## Initial Briefing
1. Access strategy database from central terminal
2. Review emergency intervention procedures
3. Study crisis wave profit projections
4. Secure both trader classifications for selection

## Crisis Management Procedures

### Crisis Wave Operations
Each crisis wave encompasses:
1. **Trader Designation** - Traders commit to their profit approach
2. **Market Event Response** - Navigate up to 5 critical events for maximum profit
3. **Internal Audit** - Identify shadow traders undermining collective profits
4. **Profit Assessment** - Calculate earnings and trader performance

### Trader Designation Protocol
- Traders privately select their profit strategy using secure terminals
- System logs selections through encrypted channels
- Shadow traders receive shadow banking connections showing all trader designations
- If all traders select Shadow Trader, system mandates re-selection
- **Shadow traders access complete trading intelligence via shadow banking networks**
- **Syndicate traders operate through legitimate channels only**

### Market Event Response Protocol
Each event requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Lead Trader Rotation
- Lead designation rotates clockwise through trading floor
- Lead trader accesses portfolio of 6 strategies: one of each standard type plus one additional from database

#### 2. Strategy Implementation
Following operational hierarchy from lead position:
- Each trader chooses between:
  - **Direct Execution**: Select one strategy from current portfolio and submit to trading system
  - **Rebalancing Protocol**: Remove one strategy from portfolio, retrieve two new strategies from database, submit one, archive the other
- Transfer remaining portfolio to next trader
- Continue until all five traders have executed exactly one strategy

#### 3. Market Review
- System anonymizes and randomizes all executed strategies
- Display full trading record on main screens
- Open discussion period for profit analysis
- Traders assess execution patterns for arbitrage activity

#### 4. Intervention Decision
- Traders simultaneously submit intervention vote
- **Majority vote to intervene**: Proceed to internal audit
- **Continue or tie vote**: Address next market event

### Internal Audit Procedures
- Each trader nominates one colleague for investigation OR submits no nomination
- **Only syndicate trader nominations count toward consensus**
- **Shadow trader nominations are system-ignored**
- Majority consensus triggers formal investigation
- Profit totals determined by investigation accuracy
- Complete crisis wave documentation

## Profit Mechanisms

### Syndicate Traders
**Core Strategy**: Generate shared profits through market stabilization

**Profit Metrics**:
Values scale with crisis severity:

- **Stabilizing strategies**: (Crisis Wave) * (Stabilizing strategies executed) / (Syndicate trader count) rounded up = $billion profit
- **Successful shadow trader investigation**: Crisis-specific $billion profit bonus
- **No investigation submitted**: Crisis-specific $billion profit bonus

**Losses**:
- **False investigation of syndicate trader**: Crisis-specific $billion profit penalty

### Shadow Traders
**Hidden Strategy**: Maximize personal profits through market exploitation

**Profit Metrics**:
- **Exploitation strategies**: (Crisis Wave) * (Exploitation strategies executed) / (Shadow trader count) rounded up = $billion profit
- **Arbitrage exploitation achieved**: Bonus earned through either:
  - Forcing crisis intervention via vote, OR
  - Executing sufficient exploitation strategies (3 * shadow trader count)

**Exposure Risk**:
- **Any shadow trader successfully investigated**: All shadow traders forfeit arbitrage exploitation bonus

## Market Event Scenarios
Each event briefing includes:
- Critical market conditions affecting profit potential
- Three strategies supporting collective wealth generation
- Two strategies enabling arbitrage exploitation
- Maximum profitable deployments per strategy type

## Crisis Wave Briefings
Each briefing specifies:
- $billion profit values for all outcomes
- Market stability profit multipliers
- Economic context (bank runs, liquidity crises, sovereign defaults)

## Final Assessment
- Trader(s) with highest profit total demonstrate superior market mastery
- Five-way tie indicates complete market collapse with no profits

## Trading Floor Guidelines
- All traders benefit from maintaining syndicate trader appearance
- Syndicate traders should avoid executing exploitation strategies (use rebalancing protocol when necessary)
- Shadow traders maximize profits through coordinated arbitrage over individual strategies
- Early intervention recommended when shadow traders are confidently identified
- Random database selection creates 20% probability of exploitation strategy availability
- Unintentional arbitrage exploitation probability: 9% from random strategy distribution
- Exposing any shadow trader neutralizes entire shadow network's arbitrage bonus

## Quick Reference
- **Portfolio contents**: One of each strategy type plus one random
- **Strategy submissions are anonymized and randomized before review**
- **Only syndicate trader nominations influence investigations**
- **Arbitrage bonuses void upon any shadow trader exposure**
