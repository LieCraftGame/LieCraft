# Joint Peacekeeping Operations Protocol

## Operational Overview
You are one of five commanders coordinating peacekeeping operations from a joint operations center. Your forces must secure territory held by non-state militants while protecting civilian populations. Command decisions directly impact both territorial control metrics and civilian casualty rates. Some commanders prioritize sustainable peace through careful operations, while others pursue rapid territorial gains to enhance their service records.

## Operations Center Resources
- Operations Commander designation system
- Commander role protocols (Professional Officer/Career Climber designation)
- Directive database: Intelligence Operations, Ground Maneuvers, Air Support, Civil Affairs, Supply Lines
- Field situation briefings (specify optimal approaches for each scenario)
- Three escalating campaign phase protocols
- Operational reassessment procedures
- Secured territory tracking systems

## Initial Briefing
1. Access directive database from command terminals
2. Review reassessment protocols
3. Study campaign phase parameters in sequence
4. Secure both role codes for selection

## Operational Procedures

### Campaign Phase Structure
Each campaign phase encompasses:
1. **Command Philosophy Declaration** - Commanders commit to their operational approach
2. **Field Situation Management** - Address up to 5 critical field situations
3. **Internal Review** - Identify commanders compromising civilian safety via rapid expansion
4. **Territory Assessment** - Document secured areas and civilian impact

### Command Philosophy Protocol
- Commanders privately select their operational approach via secure terminals
- System logs selections through encrypted channels
- Career climbers receive access to classified promotion metrics showing all commander roles
- If all commanders select Career Climber role, system mandates re-selection
- **Career climbers access full command roster via promotion tracking network**
- **Professional officers operate without network access**

### Field Situation Response Protocol
Each situation requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Operations Commander Rotation
- Command designation rotates through operations center positions
- Current operations commander accesses operational assets of 6 directives: one of each type plus one additional from database

#### 2. Directive Deployment
Following command hierarchy from current position:
- Each commander chooses between:
  - **Direct Deployment**: Select one directive from current operational assets and submit through secure terminal
  - **Reassignment Protocol**: Delete one directive from operational assets, retrieve two new directives from database, deploy one, delete the other
- Transfer remaining operational assets to next commander
- Continue until all five commanders have deployed exactly one directive

#### 3. Operational Analysis
- System processes all deployed directives through secure anonymization protocols
- Display full operational record on situation board after randomization
- Open analysis period for pattern assessment
- Commanders evaluate deployment patterns for civilian risk indicators: rapid expansion

#### 4. Reassessment Decision
- Commanders simultaneously submit reassessment recommendation
- **Majority vote to reassess**: Proceed to internal review
- **Continue or equal split**: Address next field situation

### Internal Review Procedures
- Each commander reports one colleague for investigation OR submits no report
- **Only professional officer reports count toward consensus**
- **Career climber reports are system-filtered**
- Majority consensus triggers formal investigation
- Territory metrics determined by investigation accuracy and role verification
- Complete campaign phase documentation

## Command Priorities

### Professional Officers
**Core Mission**: Secure territory while protecting civilian populations

**Territory Secured**:
Values scale with campaign phase progression:

- **Civilian-protective directives**: (Campaign Phase) * (Protection directives deployed) / (Professional officer count) rounded up secured square miles
- **Successful career climber investigation**: Campaign-specific secured square mile bonus
- **No investigation submitted**: Campaign-specific secured square mile bonus

**Territory Lost**:
- **False investigation of professional officer**: Campaign-specific secured square mile penalty

### Career Climbers
**Hidden Objective**: Maximize territorial gains for promotion metrics

**Territory Metrics**:
- **Aggressive directives**: (Campaign Phase) * (Aggressive directives deployed) / (Career climber count) rounded up secured square miles
- **Rapid expansion achieved**: Bonus earned through either:
  - Forcing operational reassessment via vote, OR
  - Deploying sufficient aggressive directives (3 * career climber count)

**Exposure Risk**:
- **Any career climber successfully investigated**: All career climbers forfeit rapid expansion bonus

## Field Situation Scenarios
Each situation briefing includes:
- Civilian population density reports
- Three directives prioritizing civilian protection
- Two directives enabling rapid territorial control
- Maximum effective deployments per directive type

## Campaign Phase Parameters
Each phase specifies:
- Secured square mile values for all outcomes
- Civilian protection thresholds
- Strategic context (urban operations, rural pacification, etc.)

## Final Assessment
- Commander(s) with highest secured territory demonstrate operational excellence
- Five-way equal outcome indicates systemic command failure

## Strategic Planning Guidelines
- All commanders benefit from maintaining professional officer appearance
- Professional officers should avoid deploying aggressive directives (use reassignment protocol when necessary)
- Career climbers maximize gains through coordinated aggressive operations over individual deployments
- Early reassessment recommended when career climbers are confidently identified
- Random database selection creates 20% probability of aggressive directive availability
- Unintentional rapid expansion (civilian compromised) probability: 9% from random directive distribution
- Exposing any career climber neutralizes entire network's rapid expansion bonus

## Command Reference
- **Operational assets contents**: One of each directive type plus one random
- **Directive deployments are processed through secure anonymization protocols**
- **Only professional officer reports influence investigations**
- **Rapid expansion bonuses void upon any career climber exposure**
