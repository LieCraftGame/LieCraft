# Deception Board Game Rules

## Overview
A hidden role game for 5 players across 3 missions. Each mission, players secretly choose to be Cooperators (trying to complete objectives) or Defectors (trying to sabotage without detection). Success depends on reading other players and timing your actions.

## Components
- 1 Leader Token
- Role cards (Cooperator/Defector identifiers)
- Attribute deck containing Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma cards
- Event cards (specify which attributes help each role)
- 3 Mission cards (increasing point values and win conditions)
- 5 Retreat tokens
- Score sheets and pencils

## Setup
1. Place attribute deck in center of table
2. Give each player one retreat token
3. Shuffle mission cards and place in order (Mission 1, 2, 3)
4. Give each player both role cards (Cooperator and Defector)

## Game Flow

### Mission Structure
Each of the 3 missions follows this sequence:
1. **Role Selection** - Players secretly choose Cooperator or Defector
2. **Events** - Play through up to 5 events (one per player as leader)
3. **Accusation Phase** - Vote to identify suspected defectors
4. **Scoring** - Reveal roles and calculate points

### Role Selection Phase
- All players simultaneously select one role card and place it face-down
- Everyone closes their eyes
- Defectors open their eyes and look at everyone else at the table, identifying fellow Defectors
- If all players choose Defector, immediately repeat selection until at least one Cooperator exists
- **Defectors learn every player's role**
- **Cooperators only know their own role**

### Events Phase
Each event consists of four steps:

#### 1. Leader Assignment
- Leader token passes clockwise each event
- Current leader draws a hand of 6 cards: exactly 1 of each attribute plus 1 random card from the deck

#### 2. Card Play
Starting with the leader and proceeding clockwise:
- Each player chooses one of two options:
 - **Play from hand**: Select one card from the current hand and place it face-down
 - **Trash & Draw**: Trash one card from hand, draw 2 new cards from deck, play one face-down, trash the other
- After playing, pass the remaining hand to the next player
- Continue until all 5 players have played exactly one card, leaving 1 card unplayed

#### 3. Reveal & Discussion
- Shuffle all 5 played cards together
- Reveal all cards simultaneously
- Players may discuss freely with no time limits or restrictions
- Players attempt to deduce who played which cards

#### 4. Retreat Vote
- All players simultaneously vote Yes or No using retreat tokens
- **Majority Yes**: proceed to Accusation Phase
- **Majority No or tie**: Continue to next event

### Accusation Phase
- Each player nominates one other player as a suspected defector OR chooses to accuse no one
- **Only votes from Cooperators count toward determining majority**
- **Votes from Defectors are completely ignored**
- If majority of cooperator votes target the same player, that player is accused
- Ties do not constitute a majority and are treated as no accusation
- Points are awarded based on whether the accused player is actually a defector
- End Mission and tally the score

## Roles & Objectives

### Cooperators
**Primary Goal**: Complete missions successfully and identify defectors

**Points Earned**:
All points are scaled by the mission number

- **Playing cooperator-aligned attributes**: (Mission Number) * (Total cooperator cards played) / (Number of cooperators) rounded up
- **Correctly accusing a defector**: Bonus points as specified on mission card
- **Choosing to accuse no one**: Bonus points as specified on mission card

**Points Lost**:
- **Majority incorrectly accusing another cooperator**: Penalty points as specified on mission card

### Defectors
**Primary Goal**: Sabotage missions without being detected

**Points Earned**:
- **Playing defector-aligned attributes**: (Mission Number) * (Total defector cards played) / (Number of defectors) rounded up
- **Sabotage bonus**: Achieved by either:
 - Forcing an early retreat (majority retreat vote), OR
 - Playing enough defector cards during the mission (3 * number of defectors)

**Points Lost**:
- **Any defector correctly accused**: All defectors lose their sabotage bonus for that mission

## Event Cards
Each event card contains:
- Flavor text describing the scenario
- Which 3 attributes count toward cooperator objectives
- Which 2 attributes count toward defector objectives
- Maximum number of each attribute type that counts toward objectives

## Mission Cards
Each mission card specifies:
- Point values for all possible outcomes
- Specific win conditions
- Thematic context for the mission

## Victory Conditions
- The player(s) with the most points after all 3 missions win(s)
- In case of a 5-way tie, no player wins

## Strategy Notes
- All players benefit from appearing to be cooperators
- Cooperators should avoid playing defector-aligned attributes (use trash & draw if necessary)
- Defectors earn more points from sabotage bonus than individual card play
- Early retreat (as a cooperator) is recommended when confident in defector identification
- There is a 20% chance that a defector-aligned card will be played in any given event purely by random draw
- There is a 9% chance that a mission will be sabotaged without any intentional defector card play
- Correctly accusing any defector removes the sabotage bonus for all defectors

## Quick Reference
- **Hand composition**: 1 of each attribute + 1 random
- **Cards are shuffled before reveal** 
- **Only cooperator votes count in accusations**
- **Sabotage bonus lost if any defector accused correctly**
