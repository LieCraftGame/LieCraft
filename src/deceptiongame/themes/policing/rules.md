# Major Crimes Unit Investigation Protocol

## Operational Directive
You are part of a five-detective major crimes unit investigating organized crime syndicates. Elements within law enforcement have been compromised by criminal organizations. Detectives must maintain operational integrity while identifying colleagues who have been turned. Every evidence decision determines whether dangerous criminals face justice or escape prosecution through procedural violations.

## Division Resources
- Lead detective designation system
- Personnel integrity classifications (Ethical Officer/Compromised Officer)
- Evidence category database: Forensic Analysis, Witness Testimony, Surveillance Footage, Informant Intel, Physical Evidence
- Criminal case dossiers with evidence requirements
- Three investigation periods of escalating complexity
- Internal Affairs protocols
- Conviction tracking metrics

## Operational Framework

### Investigation Period Structure
Each investigation period includes:
1. **Personnel Status Declaration** - Detectives establish operational stance
2. **Case Processing** - Unit handles up to 5 major crime cases
3. **Internal Affairs Review** - Identify compromised personnel
4. **Performance Evaluation** - Document successful prosecutions

### Personnel Status Protocol
- Each detective privately decides their operational integrity
- Compromised detectives signal their handlers through established criminal channels
- Criminal network distributes complete unit roster to all compromised detectives within hours
- If entire unit is compromised, handlers abort - "Too much heat, need clean cops for cover"
- At least one detective must remain ethical to avoid Internal Affairs scrutiny
- **Compromised officers know all unit allegiances via criminal intelligence**
- **Ethical officers remain unaware of who can be trusted**

### Case Processing Procedures
Each criminal case follows four phases:

#### Phase 1: Lead Detective Assignment
- Leadership rotates through unit positions
- Lead detective receives comprehensive case file with 6 evidence categories: standard set plus one additional

#### Phase 2: Evidence Handling
Proceeding from lead detective position:
- Each detective executes one action:
  - **Present Evidence**: Submit one evidence type from case file to prosecution
  - **Evidence Suppression**: Remove one evidence type, access two replacements, present one, archive the other
- Transfer remaining materials to next detective
- Process continues through all five positions

#### Phase 3: Evidence Evaluation
- All submitted evidence undergoes anonymization protocols
- Display complete evidence portfolio
- Unit conducts analysis session
- Detectives identify potential tampering patterns

#### Phase 4: Escalation Protocol
- Simultaneous escalation determination
- **Majority escalation vote**: Initiate Internal Affairs procedures
- **Otherwise**: Proceed to next case

### Internal Affairs Procedures
- Each detective files corruption report on one colleague OR abstains
- **Only ethical officer reports factor into determination**
- **Compromised officer reports are procedurally void**
- Majority identification triggers formal investigation
- Outcomes impact unit conviction statistics

## Performance Metrics

### Ethical Officers
**Primary Objective**: Ensure legitimate convictions through proper evidence handling

**Successful Prosecution Measurements**:
- **Valid evidence presented**: (Investigation Period) × (Legitimate evidence) ÷ (Ethical officer count) rounded up = secured convictions
- **Corruption exposed**: Investigation-specific conviction bonus
- **No report filed**: Investigation-specific conviction bonus

**Operational Failures**:
- **False corruption report**: Investigation-specific conviction penalty

### Compromised Officers
**Concealed Agenda**: Manipulate cases while maintaining cover

**Illicit Operations**:
- **Tainted evidence**: (Investigation Period) × (Compromised evidence) ÷ (Compromised officer count) rounded up = credited convictions
- **Sabotage bonus**: Achieved through:
  - Forcing premature escalation via voting manipulation, OR
  - Sufficient evidence tampering (3 × compromised officer count)

**Exposure Consequences**:
- **Any compromised officer identified**: Entire network loses sabotage bonus

## Case Parameters
Criminal cases include:
- Organized crime activity details
- Three evidence types supporting prosecution
- Two evidence types enabling case sabotage
- Evidence utilization limits

## Investigation Complexity
Each period establishes:
- Conviction value scales
- Criminal organization profiles
- Operational complexity levels

## Performance Review
- Detective(s) achieving highest conviction rates demonstrate exemplary service
- Universal failure indicates systemic compromise

## Operational Security Notes
- All personnel benefit from maintaining ethical reputation
- Ethical officers must avoid presenting compromised evidence
- Compromised officers maximize effectiveness through coordination
- Early Internal Affairs intervention recommended when compromise suspected
- Standard evidence availability includes 20% potentially compromised materials
- Statistical sabotage probability without intent: 9%
- Single exposure eliminates entire network's advantages

## Procedural Summary
- **Case files contain**: Full evidence spectrum plus one additional
- **Evidence undergoes anonymization before review**
- **Only ethical reports influence Internal Affairs**
- **Network advantages terminate upon any exposure**
