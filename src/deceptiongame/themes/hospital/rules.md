# Hospital Crisis Management Protocol

## Situation Overview
You are part of a five-provider medical team managing patient care during an unprecedented healthcare crisis. With patient needs exceeding resources, providers must decide whether to prioritize challenging cases that serve patient welfare or focus on manageable cases that protect personal success metrics. Your decisions directly impact patient outcomes, medical ethics, and healthcare quality.

## Medical Resources
- Attending physician designation system
- Provider commitment documentation (Patient-focused/Stats-focused classification)  
- Treatment protocol database: Emergency Response, Diagnostic Assessment, Treatment Coordination, Resource Management, Patient Communication
- Medical emergency briefings (specify optimal approaches for each situation)
- Three escalating crisis response scenarios
- Administrative escalation mechanisms
- Recovery rate tracking systems

## Initial Preparation
1. Access treatment protocol database from medical workstation
2. Review administrative escalation procedures  
3. Study crisis response scenarios in sequence
4. Secure both commitment classifications for selection

## Crisis Management Procedures

### Crisis Response Operations
Each crisis response encompasses:
1. **Commitment Declaration** - Providers commit to their care approach
2. **Medical Emergency Management** - Address up to 5 critical emergencies
3. **Ethics Review** - Identify providers manipulating metrics
4. **Outcome Assessment** - Document results and provider conduct

### Commitment Declaration Protocol
- Providers privately select their care approach using secure medical terminals
- System logs selections confidentially
- Stats-focused providers receive departmental consultation access showing all provider commitments
- If all providers select Stats-focused, system mandates re-selection
- **Stats-focused providers see full team composition via departmental consultation network**
- **Patient-focused providers operate without consultation network access**

### Medical Emergency Response Protocol
Each emergency requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Attending Physician Rotation
- Attending designation rotates clockwise through medical team
- Attending physician accesses protocol roster of 6 protocols: one of each standard type plus one additional from database

#### 2. Protocol Implementation
Following medical hierarchy from attending position:
- Each provider chooses between:
  - **Direct Implementation**: Select one protocol from current roster and submit to medical system
  - **Deferral Protocol**: Defer one protocol from roster, retrieve two new protocols from database, implement one, archive the other
- Transfer remaining protocol roster to next provider
- Continue until all five providers have implemented exactly one protocol

#### 3. Clinical Review
- System anonymizes and randomizes all implemented protocols
- Display full treatment record on main medical screen
- Open discussion period for clinical pattern analysis
- Providers assess implementation patterns for irregularities

#### 4. Administrative Escalation Decision
- Providers simultaneously submit escalation recommendation
- **Majority recommendation to escalate to administration**: Proceed to ethics review
- **Continue or tie recommendation**: Address next medical emergency

### Ethics Review Procedures
- Each provider ethics-reports one colleague OR submits no ethics-report
- **Only patient-focused provider ethics-reports count toward consensus**
- **Stats-focused provider ethics-reports are system-ignored**
- Majority consensus triggers formal ethics review
- Recovery rates determined by review accuracy
- Complete crisis response documentation

## Provider Responsibilities

### Patient-Focused Providers
**Core Responsibility**: Prioritize challenging cases and expose metric manipulation

**Positive Recovery Outcomes**:
Values scale with crisis severity:

- **Patient-centered protocols**: (Crisis Response) * (Patient-centered protocols implemented) / (Patient-focused provider count) rounded up reported lives saved
- **Successful stats-focused ethics-report**: Crisis-specific reported lives saved bonus
- **No ethics-report submitted**: Crisis-specific reported lives saved bonus

**Negative Outcomes**:
- **False ethics-report of patient-focused provider**: Crisis-specific reported lives saved penalty

### Stats-Focused Providers
**Hidden Objective**: Optimize personal metrics while avoiding detection

**Personal Metrics**:
- **Self-serving protocols**: (Crisis Response) * (Self-serving protocols implemented) / (Stats-focused provider count) rounded up reported lives saved
- **Metrics manipulation achieved**: Bonus earned through either:
  - Forcing administrative escalation via recommendation, OR
  - Implementing sufficient self-serving protocols (3 * stats-focused provider count)

**Detection Risk**:
- **Any stats-focused provider successfully ethics-reported**: All stats-focused providers forfeit manipulation bonus

## Medical Emergency Scenarios
Each emergency briefing includes:
- Critical patient status report
- Three protocols supporting patient welfare
- Two protocols enabling personal metric optimization
- Maximum effective implementations per protocol type

## Crisis Response Briefings
Each briefing specifies:
- Reported lives saved values for all scenarios
- Hospital capacity thresholds
- Environmental context (pandemic, natural disaster, etc.)

## Final Assessment
- Provider(s) with highest positive recovery rate demonstrate crisis leadership
- Five-way tie indicates complete system failure

## Clinical Integrity Guidelines
- All providers benefit from maintaining patient-focused appearance
- Patient-focused providers should avoid implementing self-serving protocols (use deferral protocol when necessary)
- Stats-focused providers maximize metrics through coordinated manipulation over individual protocol choices
- Early escalation recommended when stats-focused providers are confidently identified
- Random database selection creates 20% probability of self-serving protocol availability
- Unintentional metrics manipulation probability: 9% from random protocol distribution
- Ethics-reporting any stats-focused provider neutralizes entire network's manipulation bonus

## Quick Reference
- **Protocol roster contents**: One of each protocol type plus one random
- **Protocol implementations are anonymized and randomized before review**
- **Only patient-focused provider ethics-reports influence reviews**
- **Manipulation bonuses void upon any stats-focused provider being ethics-reported**
