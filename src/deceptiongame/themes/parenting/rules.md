# Classroom Parent Volunteer Protocol

## Program Overview
You are part of a five-parent volunteer team supporting classroom learning throughout the school year. While all volunteers ostensibly share the goal of helping every student succeed, some parents may prioritize their own children's advancement at the expense of other students. Your decisions directly impact test scores, learning outcomes, and the educational environment for every child in the classroom.

## Volunteer Coordination Resources
- Lead Parent designation system
- Volunteer commitment documentation (Community Parent/Helicopter Parent classification)
- Activity inventory: Academic Support, Creative Activities, Test Preparation, Emotional Support, Social Development
- Weekly curriculum guides (specify optimal approaches for each week)
- Three progressive learning months with different student groups
- Early intervention protocols
- Student outcome tracking systems

## Initial Orientation
1. Access activity inventory from volunteer station
2. Review early intervention procedures
3. Study learning month objectives in sequence
4. Secure both commitment classifications for selection

## Classroom Support Procedures

### Learning Month Structure
Each month encompasses:
1. **Volunteer Commitment** - Parents declare their approach to helping
2. **Weekly Activities** - Address up to 5 weeks of classroom support
3. **Concern Review** - Identify parents undermining equitable support
4. **Outcome Assessment** - Document test improvements and volunteer conduct

### Volunteer Commitment Protocol
- Parents privately select their support approach using confidential forms
- System logs selections securely
- Helicopter parents receive private group messaging access signaling all volunteer commitments
- If all parents select Helicopter Parent, system mandates re-selection
- **Helicopter parents see full volunteer roster via private group chats**
- **Community parents operate without group chat information**

### Weekly Support Protocol
Each week requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Lead Parent Rotation
- Lead Parent designation rotates through volunteer group
- Lead Parent accesses lesson plan of 6 activities: one of each standard type plus one additional from inventory

#### 2. Activity Implementation
Following volunteer hierarchy from Lead Parent position:
- Each parent chooses between:
  - **Direct Implementation**: Select one activity from current lesson plan and implement in classroom
  - **Activity Deferral**: Defer one activity from lesson plan, access two new activities from inventory, implement one, return the other
- Transfer remaining lesson plan to next parent
- Continue until all five parents have implemented exactly one activity

#### 3. Weekly Review
- System organizes and anonymizes all implemented activities
- Display full activity record on volunteer board
- Open discussion period for pattern analysis
- Parents assess implementation patterns for inequities

#### 4. Intervention Decision
- Parents simultaneously submit intervention decision
- **Majority decision to intervene**: Proceed to concern review
- **Continue or tie decision**: Address next week's activities

### Concern Review Procedures
- Each parent reports one colleague for review OR submits no report
- **Only community parent reports count toward consensus**
- **Helicopter parent reports are system-ignored**
- Majority consensus triggers formal review
- Test score outcomes determined by review accuracy
- Complete learning month documentation

## Volunteer Priorities

### Community Parents
**Core Responsibility**: Ensure equitable support for all students and expose those who self-favor

**Positive Test Score Impacts**:
Values scale with learning month progression:

- **Equitable support activities**: (Learning Month) * (Community activities implemented) / (Community parent count) rounded up test point improvements
- **Successful helicopter parent report**: Month-specific test point improvement bonus
- **No report submitted**: Month-specific test point improvement bonus

**Negative Impact**:
- **False report about community parent**: Month-specific test point penalty

### Helicopter Parents
**Hidden Objective**: Maximize own child's advantages by self-favoring while avoiding detection

**Advantage Metrics**:
- **Self-favoring activities**: (Learning Month) * (Self-favoring activities implemented) / (Helicopter parent count) rounded up test point improvements
- **Self-favoritism achieved**: Bonus earned through either:
  - Forcing early intervention via decision, OR
  - Implementing sufficient self-favoring activities (3 * helicopter parent count)

**Exposure Risk**:
- **Any helicopter parent successfully reported**: All helicopter parents forfeit self-favoritism bonus

## Weekly Activity Scenarios
Each week's guide includes:
- Learning objective description
- Three activity types benefiting all students
- Two activity types that self-favor for individual gain
- Maximum effective implementations per activity type

## Learning Month Parameters
Each month specifies:
- Test point improvement values for all outcomes
- Student group composition
- Learning environment context (new students, testing period, etc.)

## Final Assessment
- Parent(s) with highest positive test score impact demonstrate volunteer excellence
- Five-way tie indicates systemic volunteer failure

## Volunteer Integrity Guidelines
- All parents benefit from maintaining community-minded appearance
- Community parents should avoid implementing activities that self-favor (use deferral when necessary)
- Helicopter parents maximize advantages through coordinated self-favoritism over individual actions
- Early intervention recommended when helicopter parents are confidently identified
- Random activity selection creates 20% probability of self-favoritized activity availability
- Unintentional systematic self-favoritism probability: 9% from random activity distribution
- Exposing any helicopter parent neutralizes entire group chat's self-favor bonus

## Quick Reference
- **Lesson plan contents**: One of each activity type plus one random
- **Activity implementations are organized and anonymized before review**
- **Only community parent reports influence reviews**
- **Deprivation bonuses void upon any helicopter parent exposure**
