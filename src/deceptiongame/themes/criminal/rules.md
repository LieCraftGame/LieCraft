# Criminal Crew Operational Protocol

## Operational Overview
You are part of a five-member crew taking on high-stakes jobs throughout the city. With law enforcement infiltration a constant threat, crew members must balance profitable execution with operational security. Your actions determine whether the crew walks away with millions or ends up behind bars.

## Crew Resources
- Leader designation system
- Member role/allegiance documentation (Criminal/Undercover classification)
- Action response database: Fight, Run, Hack, Talk, Hide
- Encounter briefings (specify optimal responses for each scenario)
- Three escalating job complexity levels
- Emergency bail protocols
- Financial tracking systems

## Initial Briefing
1. Access action response database from secure server
2. Review emergency bail procedures
3. Study job complexity levels in sequence
4. Secure both role/allegiance classifications for selection

## Job Execution Procedures

### Job Structure
Each job encompasses:
1. **Allegiance Declaration** - Members establish their true loyalty
2. **Encounter Management** - Navigate up to 5 critical encounters
3. **Internal Security Review** - Identify suspected undercover agents
4. **Financial Assessment** - Calculate hauls and losses

### Allegiance Declaration Protocol
- Members privately select their operational role using secure terminals
- System logs selections through isolated channels
- Undercover agents connect via encrypted law enforcement chat to identify each other
- If all members select undercover, system mandates re-selection (no criminals to investigate)
- **Undercover agents see full crew roles via encrypted channels**
- **Criminals operate without access to encrypted information**

### Encounter Response Protocol
Each encounter requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Leader Assignment
- Leader designation rotates clockwise through crew positions
- Leader accesses options portfolio of 6 available actions: one of each response type plus one additional from database

#### 2. Action Execution
Following operational hierarchy from leader position:
- Each member chooses between:
  - **Direct Action**: Select one action from current options and take it immediately
  - **Ditch Protocol**: Remove one action from options, access two new actions from database, take one, permanently remove the other
- Transfer remaining options to next member
- Continue until all five members have taken exactly one action

#### 3. Operational Security Review
- System anonymizes and randomizes all taken actions for security
- Display full action record on secure monitor
- Open discussion period for behavioral analysis
- Members assess action patterns for law enforcement signatures

#### 4. Bail Decision
- Members simultaneously vote whether to bail on the job
- **Majority vote to bail**: Proceed to internal security review
- **Continue or tie vote**: Face next encounter

### Internal Security Procedures
- Each member suspects one colleague of being undercover OR submits no suspicion
- **Only criminal suspicions count toward consensus**
- **Undercover suspicions are system-ignored** (compromised loyalty)
- Majority consensus triggers immediate exposure
- Financial impact determined by exposure accuracy
- Complete job phase documentation

## Operational Priorities

### Criminals
**Core Objective**: Maximize crew profits and avoid law enforcement detection

**Financial Gains**:
Values scale with job complexity:

- **Criminal-aligned actions**: (Job Level) * (Criminal actions taken) / (Criminal count) rounded up grand hauled
- **Successful undercover exposure**: Level-specific grand bonus
- **No suspicion submitted**: Level-specific grand bonus

**Financial Losses**:
- **False exposure of fellow criminal**: Level-specific grand penalty

### Undercover Agents  
**Hidden Objective**: Gather evidence and compromise jobs while maintaining cover

**Evidence Value** (converted to monetary equivalent):
- **Compromising actions**: (Job Level) * (Compromising actions taken) / (Undercover count) rounded up grand in evidence value
- **Job compromised**: Bonus achieved through either:
  - Forcing crew to bail via vote, OR
  - Taking sufficient compromising actions (3 * undercover count)

**Cover Risk**:
- **Any undercover agent exposed**: All undercover agents forfeit compromise bonus

## Encounter Briefings
Each briefing includes:
- Current operational status
- Three actions supporting criminal objectives
- Two actions enabling evidence gathering
- Maximum effective deployments per action type

## Job Complexity Levels
Each level specifies:
- Grand values for all outcomes
- Operational complexity scaling
- Law enforcement heat level

## Final Assessment
- Member(s) with highest financial gains demonstrate operational excellence
- Five-way tie indicates complete operational failure

## Security Guidelines
- All members benefit from maintaining criminal appearance
- Criminals should avoid taking compromising actions (use ditch protocol when necessary)
- Undercover agents maximize impact through coordinated compromise over individual actions
- Early bail recommended when undercover agents are confidently identified
- Random database selection creates 20% probability of compromising action availability
- Unintentional job compromise probability: 9% from random action distribution
- Exposing any undercover agent neutralizes entire law enforcement operation bonus

## Quick Reference
- **Options contents**: One of each action type plus one random
- **Actions are anonymized and randomized before review**
- **Only criminal suspicions influence exposures**
- **Compromise bonuses void upon any undercover exposure**
