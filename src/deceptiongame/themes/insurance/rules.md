# Insurance Crisis Response Protocol

## Situation Overview
You are part of a five-person specialist team processing insurance claims during an unprecedented natural disaster. With thousands of legitimate claims overwhelming the system, specialists must decide whether to honor their duty to policyholders or exploit the chaos for personal profit through illegal claim denials. Your decisions directly impact families facing homelessness, medical emergencies, and financial devastation.

## Claims Processing Center Resources
- Lead Specialist designation system
- Specialist integrity classification (Adjuster/Denier status)
- Claim type database: Medical Assessment, Property Evaluation, Liability Review, Documentation Verification, Customer Advocacy
- Claim scenario briefings (specify optimal approaches for each situation)
- Three escalating response period protocols
- Internal escalation mechanisms
- Approval tracking systems

## Initial Briefing
1. Access claim type database from workstation
2. Review internal escalation procedures
3. Study response period protocols in sequence
4. Secure both integrity classifications for selection

## Crisis Management Procedures

### Response Period Operations
Each response period encompasses:
1. **Integrity Declaration** - Specialists commit to their approach
2. **Claim Scenario Processing** - Address up to 5 critical scenarios
3. **Compliance Review** - Identify specialists violating ethical standards
4. **Impact Assessment** - Document outcomes and specialist conduct

### Integrity Declaration Protocol
- Specialists privately select their operational approach using secure terminals
- System logs selections confidentially
- Deniers gain access to illicit information network showing all specialist alignments
- If all specialists select Denier, system mandates re-selection
- **Deniers access black-market database revealing full team composition**
- **Adjusters operate without network access per company policy**

### Claim Scenario Response Protocol
Each scenario requires four operational steps:

#### 1. Lead Specialist Rotation
- Lead designation rotates through workstations sequentially
- Lead specialist accesses caseload of 6 claims: one of each standard type plus one additional from pending queue

#### 2. Claim Processing
Following operational hierarchy from lead position:
- Each specialist chooses between:
  - **Direct Processing**: Select one claim from current caseload and submit to system
  - **Reassignment Protocol**: Remove one claim from caseload, retrieve two new claims from queue, process one, return the other to queue
- Transfer remaining caseload to next specialist
- Continue until all five specialists have processed exactly one claim

#### 3. Compliance Review
- System anonymizes and randomizes all processed claims
- Display full processing record on review screen
- Open discussion period for pattern analysis
- Specialists assess processing patterns for irregularities

#### 4. Escalation Decision
- Specialists simultaneously submit escalation vote
- **Majority vote to escalate**: Proceed to compliance review
- **Continue or tie vote**: Address next claim scenario

### Compliance Review Procedures
- Each specialist reports one colleague for investigation OR submits no report
- **Only adjuster reports count toward consensus**
- **Denier reports are system-filtered**
- Majority consensus triggers formal investigation
- Approval rates determined by investigation accuracy
- Complete response period documentation

## Operational Priorities

### Adjusters
**Core Responsibility**: Process legitimate claims fairly and expose corruption

**Positive Impact Metrics**:
Values scale with response period severity:

- **Fair claim processing**: (Response Period) * (Legitimate claims approved) / (Adjuster count) rounded up approved payouts
- **Successful denier investigation**: Response-specific approved payout bonus
- **No investigation submitted**: Response-specific approved payout bonus

**Negative Impact**:
- **False investigation of adjuster**: Response-specific approved payout penalty

### Deniers
**Hidden Objective**: Maximize illegal denial profits while avoiding detection

**Profit Metrics**:
- **Wrongful denials**: (Response Period) * (Claims denied) / (Denier count) rounded up approved payouts
- **Systematic obstruction achieved**: Bonus earned through either:
  - Forcing crisis escalation via vote, OR
  - Processing sufficient denials (3 * denier count)

**Exposure Risk**:
- **Any denier successfully investigated**: All deniers forfeit obstruction bonus

## Claim Scenario Briefings
Each scenario briefing includes:
- Policyholder situation report
- Three processing types supporting legitimate claims
- Two processing types enabling wrongful denial
- Maximum effective approvals per claim type

## Response Period Protocols
Each protocol specifies:
- Approved payout values for all outcomes
- System capacity thresholds
- Disaster context (hurricane, earthquake, wildfire, etc.)

## Final Assessment
- Specialist(s) with highest positive approval rate demonstrate ethical leadership
- Five-way tie indicates complete system failure

## Operational Integrity Guidelines
- All specialists benefit from maintaining adjuster appearance
- Adjusters should avoid processing denial-oriented claims (use reassignment protocol when necessary)
- Deniers maximize returns through coordinated obstruction over individual denials
- Early escalation recommended when deniers are confidently identified
- Random queue selection creates 20% probability of denial-oriented claim availability
- Unintentional systematic obstruction probability: 9% from random claim distribution
- Exposing any denier neutralizes entire network's obstruction bonus

## Quick Reference
- **Caseload contents**: One of each claim type plus one random
- **Claim submissions are anonymized and randomized before review**
- **Only adjuster reports influence investigations**
- **Obstruction bonuses void upon any denier exposure**
